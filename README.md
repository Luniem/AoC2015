# AoC2015

Catching up with Advent of Code 2015 in order to prepare for upcoming Advent of Code 2024.

The code is going to be written in **Rust**. :crab:

- The solutions don't aim for fastest performance or best memory usage.
- The goal is to write code that solves the problems in adequate time and required hardware.
- Therefore bruteforce can be a fine solution, since in most cases it needs to be highly optimized.

## Run a solution

To run the solution for a specific day, enter:

`cargo run`

For now the specific day to be executed is decided in the main.rs.
